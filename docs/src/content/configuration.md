# Configuration

## Config location

repartee stores its configuration in `~/.repartee/config.toml`. This file is created automatically on first run with sensible defaults.

The full directory layout:

```
~/.repartee/
  config.toml          # main configuration
  .env                 # credentials (passwords, SASL)
  themes/              # custom themes
  scripts/             # user scripts (Lua)
  logs/messages.db     # chat logs (SQLite)
  dicts/               # Hunspell dictionaries (.dic/.aff)
  sessions/            # Unix sockets for detached sessions
  certs/               # TLS certificates for web frontend
```

## Sections explained

### `[general]`

Global identity and behavior. The `nick`, `username`, and `realname` are used as defaults for all servers unless overridden per-server. Set `theme` to the name of a theme file in `~/.repartee/themes/` (without the `.theme` extension). `flood_exemptions` accepts bare nick patterns or full `nick!user@host` wildcard masks that bypass local incoming `PRIVMSG` flood checks.

### `[display]`

Controls how messages are rendered. `nick_column_width` sets the fixed-width column for nicks in chat view. `scrollback_lines` is the number of messages kept in memory per buffer. `backlog_lines` sets how many historical messages to load from the log database when a channel, query, or DCC buffer is first opened (0 to disable).

**Mentions buffer:** `mentions_buffer = true` (default) shows a persistent Mentions buffer pinned at the top of the sidebar. It aggregates all highlight mentions from all networks in a scrollable chat view. Scrollback is capped at 7 days or 1000 messages. Use `/clear` in the mentions buffer to wipe all stored mentions. Set to `false` to hide the buffer (mentions are still stored in the database and will reappear when re-enabled).

**Nick coloring:** `nick_colors = true` enables deterministic per-nick coloring (WeeChat-style). Each nick gets a consistent color based on a hash of its name. Truecolor terminals use an HSL hue wheel (~360 distinct colors); 256-color terminals fall back to a curated 68-color palette; 16-color terminals use 12 safe ANSI colors. Terminal capability is auto-detected (and re-detected on `repartee a` reattach). Set `nick_colors_in_nicklist = false` to keep the sidebar nick list using theme colors while chat messages stay colored. Tune `nick_color_saturation` and `nick_color_lightness` (0.0–1.0) per theme — dark themes work well with ~0.65, light themes around ~0.40.

### `[sidepanel]`

Left panel shows buffer list, right panel shows nick list. Set `visible = false` to hide a panel. Widths are in terminal columns.

### `[statusbar]`

Configure which items appear in the status line. Available items: `active_windows`, `nick_info`, `channel_info`, `lag`, `time`.

### `[servers.*]`

Each server gets a unique identifier (the key after `servers.`). The `channels` array lists channels to auto-join on connect. Channels with keys use the format `"#channel key"`.

Set `sasl_mechanism` to override automatic mechanism selection. Available: `PLAIN` (default), `EXTERNAL` (client TLS certificate), `SCRAM-SHA-256` (secure challenge-response).

Set `bind_ip` to bind to a specific local IP address when connecting. Useful for multi-IP hosts (vhosts/bouncers). Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 — DNS resolution automatically filters to match the address family. Can also be set per-connection with `/connect -bind=<ip>` or `/server add -bind=<ip>`.

### `[logging]`

Chat logging to SQLite. When `encrypt = true`, messages are encrypted with AES-256-GCM. `retention_days = 0` keeps logs forever. `event_retention_hours` controls how long event messages (join/part/quit/nick/kick/mode) are kept before automatic pruning — defaults to 72 hours. Set to `0` to keep event messages forever. Event pruning runs hourly in the background and is independent of `retention_days`.

### `[aliases]`

Custom command shortcuts. The key is the alias name, the value is the command template.

Templates support positional args (`$0`-`$9`), range args (`$1-`), all args (`$*`), context variables (`$C` channel, `$N` nick, `$S` server, `$T` buffer), and command chaining with `;`. If no `$` appears in the template, `$*` is appended automatically.

```toml
[aliases]
ns = "/msg NickServ $*"
cs = "/msg ChanServ $*"
wc = "/close"
j = "/join $0; /msg $0 hello everyone"
w = "/who $C"
```

Manage at runtime with `/alias` and `/unalias`.

### `[scripts]`

The `autoload` array lists script names to load on startup. Scripts live in `~/.repartee/scripts/` as `.lua` files.

### `[dcc]`

DCC (Direct Client-to-Client) chat settings. DCC CHAT establishes peer-to-peer TCP connections that bypass the IRC server.

`own_ip` overrides the IP address advertised in DCC offers. When empty, Repartee auto-detects from the IRC socket's local address (like irssi's `getsockname`). Set this to your public IP if behind NAT.

`port_range` controls the TCP port for DCC listeners. `"0"` lets the OS assign a free port. Use `"1025 65535"` or `"5000-5100"` to restrict to a range (useful for firewall rules).

`autochat_masks` is a list of `nick!ident@host` wildcard patterns. Incoming DCC CHAT offers matching any pattern are auto-accepted without prompting.

### `[spellcheck]`

Inline spell checking. When `enabled = true`, misspelled words are underlined in red while typing. Press Tab to cycle suggestions, Space to accept, Escape to revert. `languages` is a list of Hunspell language codes (e.g., `en_US`, `pl_PL`, `de_DE`) — a word is correct if **any** active dictionary accepts it. Place `.dic`/`.aff` files in `~/.repartee/dicts/` (or set `dictionary_dir` to a custom path).

### `[web]`

Embedded web frontend. When `enabled = true` and `WEB_PASSWORD` is set in `.env`, the app starts an HTTPS server alongside the terminal interface. Both share the same state — read a message on web, it's marked read on terminal, and vice versa.

Set `bind_address = "0.0.0.0"` to allow LAN access. TLS is always on — if no custom cert/key is provided, a self-signed certificate is auto-generated in `~/.repartee/certs/`.

The `theme` setting controls the web UI appearance. Available: `nightfall` (default dark), `catppuccin-mocha`, `tokyo-storm`, `gruvbox-light`, `catppuccin-latte`.

### `[[ignores]]`

Ignore patterns for filtering unwanted messages. Uses wildcard matching (`*!*@host`). Levels: `MSGS`, `PUBLIC`, `NOTICES`, `ACTIONS`, `JOINS`, `PARTS`, `QUITS`, `NICKS`, `KICKS`, `CTCPS`, `ALL`.

## Credentials

Passwords and SASL credentials should **not** go in `config.toml` — store them in `~/.repartee/.env` instead.

```bash
# ~/.repartee/.env
LIBERA_SASL_USER=mynick
LIBERA_SASL_PASS=hunter2
LIBERA_PASSWORD=serverpassword
WEB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
```

Server credentials use the server identifier uppercased. `WEB_PASSWORD` is required for the web frontend — the server won't start without it.

## Runtime changes

- **`/set section.field value`** — change a config value at runtime. Changes are saved immediately.
- **`/reload`** — reload theme and config from disk.
